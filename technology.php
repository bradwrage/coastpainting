			<p>Optogenetics has gained rapid acceptance globally and is being used by hundreds of laboratories worldwide. Of note, Nature named optogenetics “Method of the Year 2010” to recognize the major impact it has had on the understanding of neural circuits and the potential it holds for future therapies [2]. The founders and team at Circuit Therapeutics are global leaders in optogenetics, gene therapy, neuromodulation, and drug discovery and development, and the company is building on an already broad portfolio of intellectual property in optogenetics.</p>
