			<h5>A neuromodulation technique to control and monitor the activities of individual neurons in living tissue.</h5>
			<p>Through region-specific injection of viral vectors containing cell-type specific promoters, opsins can be targeted with a high degree of specificity to particular neurons of interest. The opsin-activating light can be directed to specific locations in the brain, providing yet another region-specific targeting capacity of optogenetics.

			<h5>Opsins are what make direct targeting of a cell possible for control. </h5>
			<p>In nature, opsins can be either excitatory, as in the case of channelrhodopsins (ChR) and other cationic channels, or inhibitory, as with chloride pumps like halorhodopsin (NpHR) providing for ground-breaking discoveries in precise intervention.</p>
